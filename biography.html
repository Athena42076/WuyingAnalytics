    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Wuying Du, a passionate data enthusiast originally from China and currently transitioning from a successful career as a Medical Scientist into the dynamic world of Data Science. I hold a PhD from the prestigious Anhui Medical University, which has provided me with a robust foundation in research methodologies and analytical thinking. 

My background in medical science has not only honed my analytical skills but also imbued me with a meticulous attention to detail and a rigorous scientific approach to problem-solving. I am well-versed in data analytics tools such as Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, and possess a keen ability to interpret complex datasets and convert raw data into actionable insights.

My professional journey has taught me that my passion lies in unraveling the stories hidden in data and using them to drive strategic decision-making and innovation. It's this passion that has driven my career transition and the creation of this portfolio, where you can find examples of my data analytics projects.

When I'm not delving into data or learning about the latest trends in Data Science, I enjoy spending my time cooking various cuisines, traveling and exploring new cultures, and capturing the precious moments of my baby's growth through videography. My family, composed of my supportive husband, two lovely sisters, and my adorable daughter, keeps me grounded and inspires me to constantly strive for greatness.

As I embark on this new professional path, I am eager to utilize my analytical skills to make a meaningful impact in the field of Data Science. I welcome collaboration and learning opportunities to further enhance my skills and contribute to innovative projects. 

Welcome to my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work.
